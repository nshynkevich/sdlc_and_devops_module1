```
dockerd_via_network: true

dockerd_ip: 0.0.0.0
dockerd_port: 2376

ca_cert: ca.pem
ca_key: ca-key.pem
ca_key_passphrase: changeme

host_ip: 10.10.10.20

server_cert_path: /etc/docker/tls/server_certs
server_cert: server-cert.pem
server_cert_key: server-key.pem

client_cert_path: /etc/docker/tls/client_certs
client_cert: cert.pem
client_cert_key: key.pem
```

Role Variables
--------------
```
tursted_users:
  - vagrant

config_file: /etc/docker/daemon.json

dockerd_via_network: false

default_ulimits_nofile_soft: 100
default_ulimits_nofile_hard: 200
default_ulimits_nproc_soft: 1024
default_ulimits_nproc_hard: 2048

Control `2.8 Enable user namespace support` currently disabled since this interferes with `selinux-enabled` configuration.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
